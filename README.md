### The Rise of AI Influencers

I believe that AI Influencers have the potential to be entertaining and a force for good. The expectation is that they will mimick the playbook followed by successful human influencers. However, AI has the potential to come up with something truly unexpected and break traditional influencer paradigms - by creating less predictable and more dynamic content. One example of this is generating personalized content on the fly during a chat with a subscriber.

In the attached notebook you will see that the user, a fireman named Jack, asks why so many firemen suffer heart attacks. Molly, a healthcare AI Influencer, is able to search the web (using Google Search) and provide a detailed and grounded response to the user's question. This is an example of personalized content being generated on the fly. Because Molly is powered by the Google Gemini model, she can produce content in multiple languages, 24/7.

## Notes
1. The influencer paradigm is not just about creating content. It's also about creating a highly tuned pipeline that hacks into the human brain, to maximize attention. The style, theme and composition of the influencer images are part of this strategy. As you view the images used in this project, be aware of what effect they are having on your own brain.
