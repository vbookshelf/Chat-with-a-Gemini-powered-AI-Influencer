# Chat with a Gemini powered AI Influencer

A simple python Jupyter notebook workflow to simulate a chat with an AI Healthcare Influencer named Molly. Molly specializes in mental health for high stress professions. She is chatting wih a fireman named Jack. 

The chat workflow includes photo sharing and access to the Google Search tool.

We expect AI Influencers to follow the playbook used by successful human influencers. However, AI has the potential to come up with something truly unexpected and break traditional influencer paradigms - by creating less predictable and more dynamic content. One example of this is generating personalized content on the fly during a chat with a subscriber.

In the attached notebook you will see that the user, a fireman named Jack, asks why so many firemen suffer heart attacks. Molly, a healthcare AI Influencer, is able to search the web (using Google Search) and provide a detailed and grounded response to the user's question. Because Molly is powered by the Google Gemini model, she can produce content in multiple languages, 24/7.


### Features of the attached chat workflow

- Creates a roleplay scenario
- Supports image sharing by both the user and Molly
- Molly has access to the Google search tool
- Runs in a Jupyter notebook
- The chat uses simple python code



### Notes

1. The influencer paradigm is not just about creating content. It's also about creating a highly tuned pipeline that hacks the human brain, to maximize attention. The style, theme and composition of the influencer images are part of this strategy. As you view the images used in this project, be aware of what effect they are having on your own brain.
2. The User's chat messages are not being displayed after the notebook is downloaded. Therefore, you won't see them when you open the attached Jupyter notebook. I don't know what's causing this.
3. You will need to add your Google API key in order to run the code.
4. I used Google Nano Banana to create the inflencer images.
